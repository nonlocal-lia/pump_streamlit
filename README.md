# Tanzanian Water Pump Prediction Model

This is a basic app that performs two functions

First, it allows for the easy mapping of the data on the functionality of water pumps to allow hypothesis formation

Second, it gives access to a trained classification model that will predict whether a hypothetical pump is function from a set of input variables

A full account of the creation of the model can be found at https://github.com/nonlocal-lia/pump_it_up_competition

A working copy of the app can be accessed at https://share.streamlit.io/nonlocal-lia/pump_streamlit/main/front_end.py
